            <h4>Inspired by a project I did a while ago.</h4>
            <h4>Imagine the map below represents the surface of an extraterrestial planet. Different shades represent different altitudes.
            We are sending a rover to explore the surface, however, the rover has limited energy and hence will only explore regions of the same
            altitude as where it lands. Clicking on a cell indicates the landing location and the algorithm selected will then show the surrounding
            region that the rover will explore.</h4>
            <h4>This program illustrates the different ways that Depth-First and Breadth-First Search traverse surrounding nodes.</h4>
