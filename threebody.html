            <h2>Three Body Problem Simulation</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the Trisolaran System from the Rememberance of Earth's Past Trilogy by Cixin Liu</p>
            <p>The simulation below depicts a solar system with three stars orbiting each other and the chaotic nature
                of three bodies influencing each other. Unlike the two-body problem which has been solved (we have an equation which
                can perfectly predict the system's state at any point) the three body problem is unsolvable - for now at least.
                After reading the Three Body Problem, I was intrigued with this idea wanted to simulate it.
            </p>
            <p>The Green, Blue & Red bodies are stars, and the yellow body is representative of the planet Trisolaris.</p>
            <p>(There is more coming to this simulation soon)</p>
